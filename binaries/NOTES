Please save the following files to the SD Card:

BOOT.bin
devicetree.dtb
uImage
uramdisk.image.gz

* DO NOT MODIFY FILE NAMES.

output.bif is used to generate BOOT.bin but, since it has been already generated, forget about it!

Just in case you want to do it yourself:
$ bootgen -image bin/output.bif -o zybo-zynq/bin/BOOT.bin
